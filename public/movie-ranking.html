<h1>The Best Web Series According to Kunal</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Web Series</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Money Hiest</h3>
<p>One of the best web series I had ever watched. This is my favourite Web series.The stratergies that they made to rob the bank was just unbelieveable.<br />
I liked the Season 1 more as compared to the Season 2. </p>

<h3>Special Ops</h3>
<p>The Indian Web Series based on the RAW officer (Himmat Singh). In which a committee is seated against Himmat Singh for Evaluating the Expenditure spend by him to carry out the operation of RAW.<br />
Both the Seasons 1 and 1.5 of the Special Ops are mind blowing of how  he Evaluate the Expenditure.

<h3>Asur</h3>
<p>Another Indian Web Series based on the RAW officer (Dhananjay Rajput). The Series is totally based on solving the case called the Asur(Devil).In this Web Series the Criminal develops a AI algorithm that predicts the behaviour and tells the next text steps of humans and start killing the people who are going to be dangerous or obstacles in his way.<br />
Both the Season 1 and 2 are mind blowing  describing how they reach the serial killer. But this is not the ends ....just waiting for season 3...
